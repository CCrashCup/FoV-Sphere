# FoV-Sphere
A Blender add-on to be used for determining the correct Field of View (FoV) and Aspect Ratio (via the Width) when importing a scene that was ripped with Ninja Ripper 2.


To arrive at the correct import values, click on each numbered step in the panel, supplying the value where needed. There are a total of four (4) import steps, two (2) for each factor, FoV and Width. The same sphere mesh file will be used every time. Before each subsequent import, delete the mesh, after all the steps before have been taken. To help keep track of where you are in the steps, each step is not active until the prior one has been done. The two (2) final values are flagged with red dots, which will turn green when each procedure successfully completes.
